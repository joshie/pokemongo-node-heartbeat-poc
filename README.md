How to run test:
LATITUDE=thelatitude LONGITUDE=thelongitude USERNAME=ptcusername PASSWORD=ptcpassword ./runme.bash

It will download node 0.10.46 for your platform (this is required for node-s2 currently)
it will compile node-s2
it will install other dependencies

Then it will run!

Just a proof of concept
